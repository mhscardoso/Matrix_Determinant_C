# Matrix_Determinant_C

This is just an algorithm that calculates the determinant of a matrix. The sourse code is "det.h". The test is "hist.c".<br>
Usage:<br>
Create a multidimensional array. A matrix of any order.<br>
Call the function "det" like...<br>
det( "order of matrix - interger",  "multidimensional array" );<br>

## How it works

The algorithm does a Laplace Expansions for the Determinant. In the first line of matrix.
