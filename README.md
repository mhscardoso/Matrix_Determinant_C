# Matrix_Determinant_C

This is just an algorithm that calculates the determinant of a matrix. The sourse code is "det.h". The test is "hist.c".
Usage:
Create a multidimensional array. A matrix of any order.
Call the function "det" like...
det( "order of matrix - interger",  "multidimensional array" );
